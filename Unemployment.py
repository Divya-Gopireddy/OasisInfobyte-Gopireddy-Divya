# Conclusion

This all about the Umployment Project.... I hope the Visualzation part is clear enough to understand the variations in the unemployment according to the States.
Here is the simple explanation....
* From Barplot we can observe that here is huge difference in the unemployment in
Tripura,Haryana,Pducherry and jharkhand.
* In 31-04-20 we can observe the high unemployment in every state.
* Uttarpradesh, Maharastra and westbengal are the highly employed States.
* when we consider the 'Area' that means Rural & urban.... Urban Area is the highly employed Area compared to Rural Area.

I hope you all like it ðŸ˜€ .....
